# language-period-analysis

## Overview

language-period-analysis is a project dedicated to the statistical analysis of changes in Arabic language structure across historical periods—specifically, comparing pre-colonial and post-colonial texts. The primary aim is to identify which linguistic forms, expressions, and sentence structures have shifted over time and to quantify these changes statistically.

## Motivation

The project is driven by the observation that while modern Arabic vocabulary appears to be essentially a subset of the pre-modern lexicon, the most significant change lies in sentence composition and structure. Key points include:

- **Vocabulary:**  
  There is a hypothesis that modern vocabulary is atrophied relative to the richer lexicon of pre-modern Arabic. However, this change might not be as profound as the shifts observed in structural elements of the language.

- **Sentence Structure and Composition:**  
  A notable shift has occurred with the borrowing of European expressions and syntactical structures. Although these borrowed forms are grammatically correct, they do not align with the traditional, pre-modern Arabic style.

- **Historical Context:**  
  These changes appear to correlate with the translation movement and the emergence of a literary elite whose primary inputs were European texts rather than classical Arabic sources. This period coincides with the colonial era, during which there was a rise in literary forms such as the novel, accompanied by a decline in traditional genres like the Trajama, Rihla, Qassida, Maqama, and others.

## Project Goals

1. **Quantitative Analysis:**  
   Use statistical language analysis to identify and quantify the linguistic forms and expressions that have changed most significantly over time.
2. **Hypothesis Testing:**  
   Test the hypothesis that modern Arabic sentence structure, influenced by European models, represents a significant departure from the pre-colonial norm.

3. **Fingerprinting Time Periods:**  
   Establish a statistical “fingerprint” for different time periods. This fingerprint could be used to measure the distance of any given text from the statistical mean of a particular era, potentially providing a tool for dating or categorizing texts.

## Approach

- **Data Collection:**  
  Gather representative corpora of Arabic texts from pre-colonial and post-colonial periods. This may include traditional literary forms as well as modern literary works.
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  Employ methods from computational linguistics and statistical modeling to analyze changes in vocabulary usage, sentence structure, and overall language composition.
- **Comparative Study:**  
  Compare and contrast the language features of the two periods to confirm or refute the hypothesis regarding vocabulary atrophy versus structural change.
